# SVG GEN
The `SVG GEN` is the plugin to generate svg.

## Problem:
The SVG Gen gives user the ability to generate SVG within the figma itself.



## User Flow.
1. User should be able to login and see the credits.
2. User should be able to generate svg using the text.
3. user should be able to drag and drop the svg within figma.
